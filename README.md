# dynamic-text

Assorted code for doing stuff with
text and dynamics. This involves both
cleaning and preparing data from text (e.g.,
transcripts or other corpora), and projecting
these texts into dynamic techniques such
as recurrence quantification.

This code is not shared as packaged function,
but as simple line-by-line demonstrations
using standard R or other code.

## text-conversion.R

Examples of converting text using R.
